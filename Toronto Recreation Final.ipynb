    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As the provincial capital of Ontario, Toronto is a prominent hub for its residents as well as the millions of tourists that visit per year. From nightlife to shopping to the arts, every corner of Toronto is packed with sites to visit and scenery to enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is a city full of exploration for tourists and opportunity for the entrepreneur. Due to the large amount of existing establishments, it may be difficult for an entrepreneur to decide on where to base their business. Where should they build a shopping center? A bar? What about a gym? On the other hand, a tourist only has a limited time to enjoy the city. Which districts should they visit based on their interests?\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, I will mainly use the foursquare api. First, I will determine the districts of Toronto by scraping Wikipedia. From these determined districts, I will use their longitude and latitude to search for venues within a 500m radius. Using the category of the found venues, I plan to cluster the districts of Toronto and visualize them in an interactive map.\n",

    "    Beautiful soup is a library used to scrape websites. This will be used to scrape wikipedia for the postal codes of the Toronto neighbourhoods.\n",

As a tourist, these areas may be of note if nightlife is not a priority. \n",

    "**Cluster 2** is noticably prominent, boasting a large percentage of venues categorized as Outdoors and Recreation. However, as a tourist, these neighbourhoods (Rosedale and Summerpark East) are residential neighbourhoods and therefore may not be very interesting to visit. As an entrepreneur, this area should be approached with caution \n",
    "\n",

This cluster is recommended if tourists wish to spend an entire day exploring, as well as enjoy the nightlife offered. For entrepreneurs, though this area does see higher traffic than the other clusters, property prices here are also higher."

    "Further analysis would provide much more clarity for each cluster. The addition of property prices for each cluster would be beneficial to both entrepreneurs as well as people moving into the city. In each category of venue, there are additional types of venues. Therefore, for further clarity, each cluster can be grouped into subclusters based on venue type. Traffic to each cluster would also be useful for entrepreneurs looking to open a business. This traffic would include the amount of people visiting, mean income, and if possible, the percentage of money spent in each category of venue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this analysis yeilded a promising foothold for further research. The most balanced neighbourhoods were in cluster 4, located in downtown Toronto. Moving further away from downtown, the other clusters generally had much fewer nighlife and arts and entertainment venues, but more outdoors, recreation, and shopping venues. The exception to this is cluster 0 which had fewer nighlife venues, but maintained the amount of arts and entertainment venues.\n",
